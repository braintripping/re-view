This is a packaging of [ProseMirror](http://prosemirror.net/) for use with [re-view](github.com/mhuebert/re-view).

ALPHA

For now, `lein npm install` and `rollup -c` to build the necessary Prosemirror bundle. (In the future we will load these libs directly.)

`re-view-prosemirror.core` has an editor configured with serialization to Markdown.

# Welcome!

Re-View is an experimental alternate toolset for front-end development in ClojureScript. It has one external dependency, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and otherwise relies only on Clojure and Google Closure standard libraries. 

Re-View was built piecemeal during the development of several real-world projects, including [this PX/16 workshop prototype](http://px16.matt.is), where it was advantageous to have full control over small set of in-house tools which could be rapidly evolved to experiment with different approaches.

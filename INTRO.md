## Welcome 

**Re-View** is an experimental toolset for front-end development in ClojureScript. It has one external dependency, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and otherwise relies only on Clojure and Google Closure standard libraries. 

Re-View has been constructed piecemeal during the development of several real-world projects, including a [PX/16 workshop prototype](http://px16.matt.is) and a beginner's ClojureScript REPL, where it was advantageous to have total control over small set of in-house tools which could rapidly evolve in response to changing requirements and ideas. The core library itself is not revolutionary in any way. It is simply a building block, designed for clarity of thought and good-enough performance for production apps.

## Current Status 

From its experimental beginnings, Re-View is gradually stabilizing into a reliable and enjoyable way to build front-end apps in ClojureScript. But it remains alpha software, and changes are frequent. This website has been created as a first step toward documenting the toolset and exploring next steps.

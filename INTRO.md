## Welcome 

**Re-View** is an experimental toolset for front-end development in ClojureScript. It has one external dependency, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and otherwise relies only on Clojure and Google Closure standard libraries. 

Re-View was built piecemeal during the development of several real-world projects, including [this PX/16 workshop prototype](http://px16.matt.is), where it was advantageous to have total control over small set of in-house tools which could rapidly evolve in response to changing requirements and ideas.

## Approach

**Tinkering** and hands-on experimentation are a more reliable guide than philosophical purity: ideas are best evaluated by trying them. When experimentation is the goal, it is often better to use in-house prototypes rather than external dependencies, otherwise one spends too much time fighting with external limitations and thinking in someone else's box.¹

**User experience** and visual design should not be an afterthought. Programming systems for user interfaces should specify good defaults and support collaboration between designers and programmers.

**Explore the edges** of 'developer' experience. Push the limits of what a 'beginner' can do with your tool. Seek clarifying ideas and abstractions that are accessible to ordinary people yet powerful enough for real-world problem solving.

## Current Status 

From its experimental beginnings, Re-View is gradually stabilizing into a reliable and enjoyable way to build front-end apps in ClojureScript, but it remains alpha software, and changes are frequent.

This website has been created as a first step toward documenting the toolset and exploring next steps.

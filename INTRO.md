**Re-View** is an experimental toolset for front-end development in ClojureScript. It has one external dependency, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and otherwise relies only on Clojure and Google Closure standard libraries. 

Re-View was built piecemeal during the development of several real-world projects, including [this PX/16 workshop prototype](http://px16.matt.is), where it was advantageous to have full control over small set of in-house tools which could be rapidly evolved in response to changing requirements and ideas.

## Current Status 

Re-View remains alpha software, and changes are frequent. This website has been created as a first step toward documenting the toolset and exploring next steps. From its experimental beginnings, Re-View is gradually stabilizing into a reliable and enjoyable way to build front-end apps in ClojureScript.

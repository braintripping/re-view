## Docs

Re-View's core library is responsible for defining components and rendering them to the page.

- [View Specs](re-view/view-specs)
- [Advanced Topics](re-view/advanced-topics)

Every web app needs to handle routing, and we have our own data-driven approach for that: 

- [Re-View Routing](routing)

As is common in Clojure, Re-View uses [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) syntax as an alternative to HTML or JSX.

- [Re-View Hiccup](hiccup/overview)
- [Hiccup Syntax Guide](hiccup/syntax-guide)


## Explainers 

We believe that docs should be as beginner-friendly as possible. To that end, we have written some beginner-friendly 'explainer' documents.

- [What is a Clojure atom?](explainers/atoms)
- [What is 'state'?](explainers/state)
- [What are views, elements, and components?](explainers/views-elements-components)
